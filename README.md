**Proposal:**

*1.	Project Description/Goals:*
  -	Account management system for Non-Profit donors
  -	Finding and renting a reliable VSP
  -	Adding all new relevent informations into the README.md textfile 

*2.	Platform of Choice:*
  -	Oracle VM Virtual Box running a Debian (64 bit) server
  -	Distro 1: Debian Live
      i.	Pros: Free, smooth upgrades, we are comfortable using it since we are most used to it
      ii.	Cons: Debian is not always up to date

  -	Distro 2: Fedora\
    i.	Pros: Enhanced security, has automatic updates\
    ii.	Cons: Desktop environment is messy, also we are not used to it because we have been using Debian

*3.	Requirements:*
  -	There will be multiple accounts that the owners can access to view their donation balances and deposit more money. There will be different kinds of accounts with     different permissions, such as donor, volunteer, and admin accounts.
  -	Any questions the users have will be answered by some programmed automatic responses, as well as the admin account will have access to ps and top.
  -	The accounts will be protected by passwords and each account type (user) will have different file permissions.
  -	Various automated scripts include: Messages when money is donated, once a goal is reached rewards will be handed out to the donors, the main donation pot will be     updated and displayed automatically after every donation, and display donor name, date and time of a donation.                    

*4.	Major Technical Solutions Compared:*
  -	We are aiming to imitate a sort of GoFundMe approach to our project, with donations and goals.

*5.	Timeline:*
  -	Week 1: Creating server and users, as well as permissions.
  -	Week 2: Writing the various scripts needed to run the background tasks, including the automatic help responses.
  -	Week 3: Implementing the scripts inside of the server, as well as running tests and debugging the project.
  -	Week 4: Presentation preparation.

*6.	Team Composition:*
  -	Natan Lellouche, Kyle Husbands, Nathaniel Bridgman
