- [Project Description:](#Project-Description:)

**Proposal:**

## *1.	Project Description:*
  -	Create a static website
  -	Finding and renting a reliable VPS
  -	Creating a rudimentary money donation interface 
 
## *2.	Platform of Choice:*
  -	Oracle VM Virtual Box running a Debian (64 bit) server
  -	Distro 1: Debian Live\
      i.	Pros: Free, smooth upgrades, we are comfortable using it since we are most used to it\
      ii.	Cons: Debian is not always up to date

  -	Distro 2: Fedora\
    i.	Pros: Enhanced security, has automatic updates\
    ii.	Cons: Desktop environment is messy, also we are not used to it because we have been using Debian

## *3.	Requirements:*
  -	There will be an option to donate money, as well as an option to send the money. The user account will have the permissions to execute the donation script but not     the sending script, and an admin account that will hold all permissions.
  -	Any questions the users have will be answered by some programmed automatic responses, as well as the admin account will have access to ps and top.
  -	The accounts will be protected by passwords and each account type (user) will have different file permissions.
  -	Various automated scripts include: Messages when money is donated, once a goal is reached rewards will be handed out to the donors, the main donation pot will be       updated and displayed automatically after every donation, and display donor name, date and time of a donation.                    

## *4.	Major Technical Solutions Compared:*
  -	We are aiming to imitate a sort of GoFundMe approach to our project, with donations and goals.

## *5.	Timeline:*
  -	Week 1: Creating server and users, as well as permissions.
  -	Week 2: Writing the various scripts needed to run the background tasks, including the automatic help responses.
  -	Week 3: Implementing the scripts inside of the server, as well as running tests and debugging the project.
  -	Week 4: Presentation preparation.

## *6.	Team Composition:*
  -	Natan Lellouche, Kyle Husbands, Nathaniel Bridgman

The IP address of the server is 149.56.12.193
